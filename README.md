Vector Clock Timestamsp Algorithm: https://vector-clock.now.sh/

## Instructions:

1. Choose the number of processes in the first select box.

2. Create an event by choosing “From” and “To” process and position from select boxes (position varies in range from 0 to 100 with step 10). Leave “To” empty if you need to create a local event (point). Fill “To” if you need to create a message (an arrow).

3. To add a new event select button “+ ADD EVENT”.

4. After you have added all events choose “CREATE” button to draw a visualization.

5. If you are satisfied with all the events choose “RUN” button to automatically calculate the vector timestamps associated with each event. Timestamps will appear near the points as well as in the table below.
